create and maintain Java APIs for manipulating various file formats based upon
the Office Open XML standards (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document
format (OLE2). In short, you can read and write MS Excel files using Java.
In addition, you can read and write MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java.
Apache POI is your Java Excel solution (for Excel 97-2008). We have a complete
API for porting other OOXML and OLE2 formats and welcome others to participate.

OLE2 files include most Microsoft Office files such as XLS, DOC, and PPT as
well as MFC serialization API based file formats. The project provides APIs
for the OLE2 Filesystem (POIFS) and OLE2 Document Properties (HPSF).

Office OpenXML Format is the new standards based XML file format found in
Microsoft Office 2007 and 2008. This includes XLSX, DOCX and PPTX. The
project provides a low level API to support the Open Packaging Conventions
using openxml4j.

For each MS Office application there exists a component module that attempts
to provide a common high level Java API to both OLE2 and OOXML document
formats. This is most developed for Excel workbooks (SS=HSSF+XSSF). Work is
progressing for Word documents (HWPF+XWPF) and PowerPoint presentations
(HSLF+XSLF).

The project has recently added support for Outlook (HSMF). Microsoft opened
the specifications to this format in October 2007. We would welcome
contributions.

There are also projects for Visio (HDGF) and Publisher (HPBF).
